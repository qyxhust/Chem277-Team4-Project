# CHEM 277B Final Project
# Topic: Predicting Neurodegenerative Disease Status From Proteomics Data Using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Graph Attention Network (GAT)
Contributors: Anna Devlen, Andrea Kim, Frank Qi, Yasemin Sucu, Leonard Wei

This repository contains code to predict neurodegenerative disease status using data from a large proteomics database maintained by the Global Neurodegenerative Proteomics Consortium (GNPC). Two models were trained for this purpose: a two-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a two-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT). The GAT incorporates a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network built using the STRING database.

The repository contents are as follows:

**data:**

**entrypoint:**

**models:**

**notebooks:**

**plots:**

**src:** The ANN folder contains the file ANN.py, which defines the ANN model and performs training, hyperparameter tuning, and plotting. This file requires the download of the torch data object 'binary_data.pt' from the Google Drive link below.

Data files that were too large to upload to GitHub are available for download from Google Drive: (LINK)
