    "\n",
    "1. We use a Graph Attention Network (GAT) on the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network to learn a numeric vector (embedding) for each protein.  \n",
    "   These embeddings combine:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - the protein’s own GNPC summary statistics, and  \n",
    "   - information from its neighbors in the PPI graph\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We train the model to predict **disease related protein signals** from the GNPC data, specifically one continuous score per protein for each of four neurodegenerative diseases:\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. \n",
    "   - Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  \n",
    "   - Parkinson’s disease (PD)  \n",
    "   - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)  \n",
    "   - ALS\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We compare this **graph-based model** (GAT, and optionally GCN) against a **non-graph baseline model** (i.e. decision tree) that uses the same protein features but ignores the PPI network.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **With that comparison we will see if using the PPI structure actually improve prediction performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use the learned protein embeddings for downstream analysis:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - cluster proteins in the embedding space,  \n",
    "   - identify “disease modules” (clusters that are AD-enriched, ALS-enriched, or pan-neurodegenerative), and  \n",
    "   - perform pathway enrichment to link each cluster to biological processes and pathways\n"
